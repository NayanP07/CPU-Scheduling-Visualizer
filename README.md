# CPU-Scheduling-Visualizer
A web-based simulator designed to visualize and compare various CPU scheduling algorithms. This tool is perfect for students and developers looking to understand the core concepts of operating system process management.Users can add custom processes (with arrival time, burst time, and priority) and then run the simulation to see a dynamically generated Gantt chart and a table of key performance metrics.

# Algorithms Implemented:

> First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)

> Shortest Job First (SJF)

> Largest Job First (LJF)

> Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)

> Priority (Non-Preemptive)

> Round Robin (RR)

# Features:

> Algorithm Information: An info panel describes each algorithm.

> Custom Process Input: Add/remove processes with custom parameters.

> Gantt Chart: A clear, color-coded Gantt chart visualizes the execution flow.

> Performance Metrics: Automatically calculates and displays:

      > Completion, Turnaround, Waiting, and Response Time for each process.

      > Average Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, and Response Time.

      > Total CPU Utilization.
